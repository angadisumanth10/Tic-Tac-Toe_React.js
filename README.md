# Tic-Tac-Toe using React.js

This project is a simple implementation of the classic Tic-Tac-Toe game using React.js. It's bootstrapped with Create React App (CRA) for quick development and deployment.

## Getting Started

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/angadisumanth10/Tic-Tac-Toe_React.js.git
   

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   
3. Start the development server.
   ```bash
   npm start

This will run the app in the development mode and open it in your default web browser at http://localhost:3000. The page will automatically reload when you make changes to the source code, and any lint errors will be displayed in the console.
